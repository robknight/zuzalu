## **ZuConnect 2023 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)**

### What are the key differences between Zuzalu Montenegro and ZuConnect Istanbul?

| |Zuzalu Montenegro |ZuConnect Istanbul |
|---|---|---|
|**Format**|Two month popup city with traditional style conferences each week<br/> |Two week popup village<br/> |
|**Duration of Topics** |Entire weeks<br/> |Half-day to one day max<br/> |
|**Objective** |Educating novices was a big part of most of the weekly conferences<br/> |Facilitating expert collaboration<br/> |
|**Programming Style** |Keynote speeches, panels, lectures<br/> |Unconferences, collaborative sessions<br/> |
|**Audience** |General, including novices<br/> |Primarily peer practitioners in various domains<br/> |

ZuConnect Istanbul is intentionally designed to deviate from traditional conference models, focusing on making the most of the precious time that leading practitioners can spend together in person. It‚Äôs not just an event; it‚Äôs a transformative two-week experience optimized for deep collaboration, trust-building, and innovation.

---

### What if I do not want to participate in the full two weeks? Can I buy a lesser ticket?

We strongly recommend participating in the full two weeks to gain the complete experience that ZuConnect has to offer. We do not offer prorated ticket prices, as this complicates event coordination. However, a limited number of day tickets may become available closer to the event date.

---

### **Who are you looking for as residents?**

ZuConnect is tailored for peer practitioners in the frontier tech and science spaces that we focus on. While some investors are welcome, the primary aim of the event is to encourage building, connecting, and knowledge-sharing among practitioners. Due to this, we will only be able to accept a very limited number of investors.

---

### **Can I still contribute funds even if I'm not going?**

Yes, if you can afford to, we strongly encourage you to sponsor a "scholar" who cannot afford the ticket price but would be a great fit for the ZuConnect community. Contributions for this purpose should not be made through the ticket purchase link but should be donated directly to Zuzalu.eth.

---

### **Can you help me with checking out on the Optimism network on Tripsha?**

Yes! We understand how this can be tricky. View this page for step by step instructions:
